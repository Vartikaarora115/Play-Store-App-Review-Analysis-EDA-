<h3>Conclusion and Bussiness Solutions</h3>
1. All the top 100 apps installed are free apps and mostly belongs to communication , games and tools category. Hence, we can infer that if an app is free it will have larger and diverse user base,so the app can do big in numbers.


2. We have observed that there is large user base of social, communication and games categories but there are not many apps available in these categories except for games. Hence, social and communication are the categories that can be tapped more by the app developers/bussiness.


3. If the app has content rating not for everyone, it will not have a large user base but if you make it more user centric targetting the selective audience the app will do well even if it is paid then.


4. Majority of the apps in playstore are small in size and have good/above average rating. While for paid apps, we have almost equal distribution in terms of size and rating.


5. On more close observation we can see apps with more data size are also given good rating.

Hence, we can infer that the apps which have more data size have better performance, resulting in better user experience and Apps that are free also has positive impact on user's choice and preference.
